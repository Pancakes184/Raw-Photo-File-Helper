# Raw-Photo-File-Helper

This code is made for organising raw file photos (.raw, .CR3, etc). You first put the file type that will be scanned,
for  example a .JPG file and then you select the file you want to change it to, for example .CR3. The program will then
ask for a directory to acess the files from then it will read the files and output a string that can be put into file
explorer that will let you easily input your raw files into Adobe Lightroom for example.

Example Output:

"IMG_8642.CR3" "IMG_8643.CR3" "IMG_8644.CR3" "IMG_8645.CR3" "IMG_8646.CR3" "IMG_8647.CR3" "IMG_8648.CR3" "IMG_8649.CR3" "IMG_8650.CR3" "IMG_8651.CR3" "IMG_8652.CR3" "IMG_8653.CR3" "IMG_8654.CR3" "IMG_8655.CR3" "IMG_8656.CR3"

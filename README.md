# Raw-Photo-File-Helper

This code is made for organising raw file photos (.raw, .CR3, etc). You first put the file type that will be scanned,
for  example a .JPG file and then you select the file you want to change it to, for example .CR3. The program will then
ask for a directory to acess the files from then it will read the files and output a string that can be put into file
explorer that will let you easily input your raw files into Adobe Lightroom for example.
